Mouse Tracking Balls
This simple JavaScript code allows you to track the mouse movement on a webpage using animated balls. The balls move in response to the mouse cursor, creating an interactive visual effect.

How It Works
The code utilizes the 'document.onmousemove' event listener to continuously track the mouse movement. When the mouse moves, the 'x' and 'y' coordinates of the cursor relative to the window are calculated. These coordinates are then used to position the balls on the screen and create a smooth tracking effect.

Usage
To use this code:

1.Ensure you have an HTML file with balls represented by elements with the class name 'ball'.
2.Include this JavaScript code in your HTML file or link it externally.
3.As the mouse moves, the balls will follow its trajectory on the screen.
