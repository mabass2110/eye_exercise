# Interactive Eyes Animation

## Description: This project creates a simple interactive animation where two "eyes" follow the mouse cursor within a browser window. The eyes are represented by balls that move dynamically as the cursor moves.

## How to Run:
1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
3. Move your mouse cursor within the window to see the eyes follow it.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:
## 1. Enhanced Eye Designs: Introduce more realistic eye designs with features like pupils and eyelids for a more engaging animation.
## 2. Customizable Animation Speed: Allow users to adjust the speed at which the eyes follow the cursor.
## 3. Mobile Compatibility: Optimize the animation for touch-based devices to provide a similar interactive experience on mobile platforms.
## 4. Interactive Elements: Implement additional interactive elements around the eyes, such as blinking or changing expressions based on cursor movements.
## 5. Accessibility Features: Ensure the animation is accessible to users with disabilities by providing alternative interaction methods or screen reader support.
